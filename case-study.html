                Currently, there’s not a cloud storage app that does it all. It
                can become frustrating for users, like myself, to switch between
                apps that do different things - Dropbox only allows you to store
                and share files, Pinterest only lets you save and share files.
                People are always looking for the next best storage space. A new
                competitor has huge shoes to fill in order to be competitive in
                the current marketplace. They need to kind of be all things for
                all people, or offer something niche to a market that really
                needs something like it.

                Cloud Storage has been something that has been on the market for
                about a decade. There are many services, some niche and some
                further reaching. I decided to focus on the companies that I,
                along with my colleagues, tend to use the most. The three
                companies offer different things to the market, but none of them
                are the one-stop shops that users are asking for. Google Drive
                allows you to store, create, and share content. Dropbox is
                strictly a store and share app. Pinterest is a visual sharing
                app.

                While there are many cloud storage apps on the market, there’s
                still room for a new app, like Wisp, to enter the market and
                break some barriers.

                      Of participants say their biggest frustration with the
                      current selection of apps is how much storage you get for
                      free vs. how much you get when you pay.

                Creating a brand for this cloud app was a huge part of the
                process. While everything else is important, the brand helps set
                the tone for the users. It can make or break a brand.
                <br />Security & trustworthiness is the most important aspect of
                a cloud storage app. You want someone to see the logo, marks,
                and colors and feel as if they can trust you to store their
                information. I took this idea and the fact that this app would
                be used by mostly young professionals to create a brand. I
                wanted it to seem secure, but I wanted it to seem current as
                well. Something light-hearted & airy, yet relatable & secure to
                help break-up the seriousness of it all. When you go back to the
                competitive analysis, the brands for those aren’t the most
                exciting. I wanted the whole brand to feel updated. <br />I took
                the words light-hearted, familiar, energetic, and secure and
                formed the brand.

                The logo evolved once I created the moodboard, the brand style
                guide, and the color palette. It went from being a bit stark and
                unfinished looking to being one cohesive brand.
                <br />
                The logo is kept simple. It will always appear as one color,
                whether that is the full-color version or the black or white
                version. I believe this is the way to go because it creates a
                bit of a trademark color and feel to the brand that doesn’t
                necessarily already exist. Think about the colors that your
                competitors use - Pinterest = red, Dropbox = blue, etc. The
                light blue hue that I chose is different from the typical
                primary colors that are used currently, however it isn’t such a
                far cry that a user won’t feel like they’re unable to trust it.
                Blue is a color that typically evokes trust and loyalty - both
                things that we want the user to feel.

                    purple, a dusty blue, a bright turquoise, and black for
                    contrast. Together these colors work as a team to help

                    feeling that we hope will draw the users in.

                    The header font is Comfortaa. I felt this complemented the
                    icon and is nice enough to tie the branding throughout the
                    website and through possible future print pieces as well.
                    The body copy will be in Roboto. Roboto is relatable, it’s a
                    font that fits nicely with most other fonts, and it’s easy
                    to read in large blocks of text.

                Like any project that you would encounter in the real-world,
                user feedback was very important. I ended up having several
                iterations of the design. They completely changed from initial
                pencil wireframes through the whole process. Here, I will layout
                the different versions that I went through.

                Version 2.0 was the version that I used for High-Fi User
                Testing. I was trying to break away from the typical hero image
                that you see on most websites these days. I thought it might
                work, but after feedback from several people, I realized that it
                just wasn’t working. Something else that I ended up changing
                drastically was the Account Dashboard page. This iteration
                doesn’t really do the job that we set out to do - make
                accessing, sharing, and viewing files easy. So, I worked on a
                new version.

                Version 3.0 came after a critique from an industry vet looked at
                my work. When you get constructive criticism it can do one of
                two things - break you or make you. I took what felt like harsh
                feedback and started working on the new version immediately. The
                landing page is the one that has ended up making it all the way
                to the end of this with me. The account dashboard has changed a
                few times, though. As you can see, it’s completely different
                from the first iteration. There are now options for viewing the
                files in a grid or list, it’s a bit cleaner than the original
                and isn’t as blocky, and most importantly, it begins to work for
                the user rather than make the user work for it.

                As I stated previously, my landing page stayed final, however I
                changed my account dashboard up a bit more after receiving more
                feedback. Main features that changed were cleaning up the
                sidebar menu and bringing it to be full-length with the page,
                extending the colored line right under the menu to go up to the
                top of the page, and cleaning up the grid to be a bit more
                uniform.

                This was my very first UX project from start to finish. It was
                certainly a challenge and the learning curve was steep - however
                the experience was incredibly valuable. I currently work on a
                team and am not responsible for copy, research, or branding. It
                was really enlightening to take the whole project from the very
                beginning with discovery all the way to the end with the whole
                finished design.
